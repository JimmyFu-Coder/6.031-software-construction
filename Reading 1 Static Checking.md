## Static checking, dynamic checking, no checking

**Static checking** can catch:
1. syntax errors
2. misspelled names
3. wrong number of arguments, 
4. wrong argument types
5. wrong return types

**Dynamic checking** can catch:
1. specific illegal argument values.   x/y   0 value
2. illegal conversions
3. out of range indices
4. call undedined

## Mutating values vs. reassigning variables

  
Change is a necessary evil. But good programmers try to avoid things that change, because they may change unexpectedly. Immutability – intentionally forbidding certain things from changing at runtime – will be a major design principle in this course.
